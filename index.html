        <h2 id="header-2">SafeTI</h2>
        <p>The Safe Traffic Injector unit acts as an AHB Master IP connected to the main AMBA bus on the SELENE Platform. It acts as a core with limited capabilities, only generating
		transactions to the bus by reading and writing to the AHB Slave RAM memory and controlled via APB registers. The injector works along with the multi-core 
		setup instantiated on the platform and other peripherals and monitoring units. In order to generate traffic to the bus, the module performs a set of AMBA 
		transactions based on data descriptors set at startup into a predefined memory address range.</p>

        <h2 id="header-2">SafeSU</h2>
        <p>The Safe Statistics Unit (SafeSU for short) is an RTL IP that implements several mechanisms for multicore timing interference verification, validation, 
		and monitoring. It has been integrated into commercial space-graded RISC-V and SparcV8 MPSoCs.</p>

        <h2 id="header-2">SafeDE</h2>
        <p>Diversity Enforcement module can be deployed to avoid unreasonable risk of a single fault leading the system to a failure and detect common-cause faults
		(CCF) derived from the logic. Diversity Enforcement hardware module providing light-lockstep support by means of a non-intrusive and flexible hardware module
		that preserves staggering across cores running redundant threads, thus bringing time diversity.</p>
