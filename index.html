        <h2 id="header-2">SafeTI</h2>
        <p>This unit acts as an AHB/AXI Master IP and as a core with limited capabilities, only generating transactions to the bus by reading
		and writing to the AHB Slave RAM memory and controlled via APB registers. The injector works along with the multi-core setup instantiated on the platform and other
		peripherals and monitoring units. The Traffic Injector is based on generic Direct Memory Access functionality fundamentals and
		extends its features to meet the injector objectives.</p>

        <h2 id="header-2">SafeSU</h2>
        <p>The Safe Statistics Unit (SafeSU for short) is an RTL IP that implements several mechanisms for multicore timing interference verification, validation, 
		and monitoring. It has been integrated into commercial space-graded RISC-V and SparcV8 MPSoCs.</p>

        <h2 id="header-2">SafeDE</h2>
        <p>Diversity Enforcement module can be deployed to avoid unreasonable risk of a single fault leading the system to afailure. Diversity Enforcement hardware module 
		providing light-lockstep support by means of a non-intrusive and flexible hardware module that preservess taggering across cores running redundant threads, 
		thus bringing time diversity.</p>
